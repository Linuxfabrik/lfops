# LFOps - Ansible Collection of Roles, Playbooks and Plugins for managing Linux-based Cloud Infrastructures

## The Purpose of LFOps

LFOps is like [DebOps](https://docs.debops.org/) a collection of *Free and Open Source tools that allow users to bootstrap and manage an IT infrastructure based on* RHEL and other operating systems. *Ansible is used as the main configuration management platform.* LFOps *provides a collection of Ansible roles that manage various services, as well as a set of Ansible playbooks that tie them together in a highly integrated environment.*

LFOps is designed to be used within the Linuxfabrik. Nevertheless, we try to keep its general-purpose as much as possible.


## Installation

To install the **stable** release of the collection:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install linuxfabrik.lfops
```

To install the **development** version of the collection (requires ansible >= 2.10):
```bash
# via HTTPS
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/lfops.git

# via SSH
ansible-galaxy collection install git@github.com:Linuxfabrik/lfops.git
```

To use the git repository directly (just for development purposes):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Linuxfabrik/lfops.git
mkdir -p ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/linuxfabrik/
ln -s /path/to/lfops ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/linuxfabrik/
```

## How to use LFOps

Example: If you want to run `playbooks/php.yml`, place your host `myhost` in the `lfops_php` group. After that, run:

```bash
ansible-playbook --inventory path/to/inventory linuxfabrik.lfops.php --limit myhost
```

For more details on group names, Ansible tags, etc., see the playbooks and README files for the roles.


## A typical Workflow Example

First, add `myhost` to the corresponding groups in your Ansible inventory.

```yaml
[lfops_hetzner_vm]
myhost

[lfops_setup_basic]
myhost

[lfops_monitoring_plugins]
myhost

[lfops_setup_nextcloud]
myhost
```

After that run the corresponding playbooks (optionally append parameters like `--diff` and/or `--check`):

```bash
ansible-playbook --inventory path/to/inventory linuxfabrik.lfops.hetzner_vm --limit myhost
```

Run the basic setup:

```bash
ansible-playbook --inventory path/to/inventory linuxfabrik.lfops.setup_basic --limit myhost
```

Deploy a component:

```bash
ansible-playbook --inventory path/to/inventory linuxfabrik.lfops.monitoring_plugins --limit myhost
```

Deploy a full-fledged application (playbooks for complex application setups are prefixed by `setup_`):

```bash
ansible-playbook --inventory path/to/inventory linuxfabrik.lfops.setup_nextcloud --limit myhost
```

Change some settings afterwards, for example in PHP:

```bash
ansible-playbook --inventory path/to/inventory linuxfabrik.lfops.setup_nextcloud --limit myhost --tags php
```


## Bitwarden

Requires the [bw CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/cli/) version v2022.9.0+.

If you want to use Bitwarden as your password manager backend, do a `lookup` in your inventory like this:

```yaml
grafana_grizzly__grafana_service_account_login:
  "{{ lookup('linuxfabrik.lfops.bitwarden_item',
    {
      'hostname': inventory_hostname,
      'purpose': 'Grafana Service Account Token',
      'username': 'grizzly',
      'collection_id': lfops__bitwarden_collection_id,
      'organization_id': lfops__bitwarden_organization_id,
    },
  ) }}"
```

Before running Ansible, unlock the access to your Bitwarden vault and start the Bitwarden RESTful API webserver as follows:

```bash
export BW_SESSION="$(bw unlock --raw)"
bw status | jq
bw serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 8087 &
```

After that run your playbook as usual:

```bash
ansible-playbook ...
```

The LFOps Bitwarden module will fetch the item from the vault and create it if it does not exist. See `ansible-doc -t lookup linuxfabrik.lfops.bitwarden_item` for all the details.

The lookup normally returns multiple keys, including the `username` and `password` subkeys. If only the password is required, use the following lookup:

```yaml
freeipa_server__directory_manager_password:
  "{{ lookup('linuxfabrik.lfops.bitwarden_item',
    {
      'hostname': inventory_hostname,
      'purpose': 'FreeIPA',
      'username': 'cn=Directory Manager',
      'collection_id': lfops__bitwarden_collection_id,
      'organization_id': lfops__bitwarden_organization_id,
    },
  )['password'] }}"
```

Beware that if you are using the lookup in `group_vars`, you probably do not want to use inventory_hostname. For example, the following would create a new login for each FreeIPA client:

```yaml
freeipa_server__ipa_admin_password:
  "{{ lookup('linuxfabrik.lfops.bitwarden_item',
    {
      'hostname': inventory_hostname,
      'purpose': 'FreeIPA',
      'username': 'admin',
      'collection_id': lfops__bitwarden_collection_id,
      'organization_id': lfops__bitwarden_organization_id,
    },
  )['password'] }}"
```

Instead, replace `inventory_hostname` with the correct FreeIPA server hostname:

```yaml
freeipa_server__ipa_admin_password:
  "{{ lookup('linuxfabrik.lfops.bitwarden_item',
    {
      'hostname': 'freeipa.example.com',
      'purpose': 'FreeIPA',
      'username': 'admin',
      'collection_id': lfops__bitwarden_collection_id,
      'organization_id': lfops__bitwarden_organization_id,
    },
  )['password'] }}"
```


## Documentation

* Ansible Roles: Each role has its own README file.
* Ansible Plugins: The documentation for all plugins is available through `ansible-doc`. For example, `ansible-doc linuxfabrik.lfops.gpg_key` shows the documentation for the GPG key managing module.


## The "all" Playbook

Imagine that you want to deploy an updated MariaDB dump script to all hosts that have a MariaDB server. This would mean that you would need to run not only the `linuxfabrik.lfops.mariadb_server` playbook, but also all playbooks that include MariaDB Server, e.g. `linuxfabrik.lfops.setup_wordpress`, etc. To simplify this, you can simply use the `linuxfabrik.lfops.all` playbook, which imports all other playbooks. Make sure you use it with `--tags` and `--limit` to get the desired effect.


## LFOps-wide Variables

There are a handful of variables that are used across roles. It is still possible to overwrite the LFOps-wide variable with the role-specific one.

### `lfops__monitoring_plugins_version`

This variable is used as the default whenever the version of the [Linuxfabrik Monitoring Plugins](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/monitoring-plugins) repo is required. Have a look at the [monitoring_plugins Role README](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/lfops/blob/main/roles/monitoring_plugins/README.md) for details.

Example:
```yaml
lfops__monitoring_plugins_version: 'main'
```

### `lfops__repo_basic_auth_login`

This variable is used as the default across all `repo_*` roles if it is set. Can be used to authenticate against the repository server using HTTP basic auth. Have a look at the respective role's README for details.

Note: Currently this only works for RPM repositories.

Example:
```yaml
repo_epel__basic_auth_login:
  username: 'mirror-user'
  password: 'linuxfabrik'
```

### `lfops__repo_mirror_url`

This variable is used as the default across all `repo_*` roles if it is set. Can be used to set the URL to a custom mirror server providing the repository. Have a look at the respective role's README for details.

Example:
```yaml
lfops__repo_mirror_url: 'https://mirror.example.com'
```

## Tips, Tricks & Troubleshooting

### ansible_become: true

Don't use `become: true` or `ansible_become: true` in role playbooks. Instead, set `ansible_become: true` in your group_vars or host_vars ONLY (not in `all.yml` - `localhost` must not be part of the group. Otherwise you'll get errors like `sudo: a password is required`).


### Finding all groups a host belongs to

When running playbooks against a host it might be useful to know all the group memberships.

```bash
ansible --inventory path/to/inventory myhost -m debug -a "var=group_names"
```


## Known Limitations

Combined lists and dictionaries (`rolename__combined_varname`) containing default values cannot be unset or overwritten, they can only be extended. If you need to overwrite to delete a pre-defined value, use `rolename__role_varname` or `rolename__combined_varname` and assign all needed values.

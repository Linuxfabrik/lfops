# Ansible Role linuxfabrik.lfops.monitoring_plugins

This role deploys the [Linuxfabik Monitoring Plugins](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/monitoring-plugins) to `/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/`, allowing them to be easily executed by a monitoring system.

Runs on

* Debian 9
* Debian 10
* Fedora
* RHEL 7 (and compatible)
* RHEL 8 (and compatible)
* Suse
* Ubuntu 16
* Windows

It also installs the [Linuxfabrik Plugin Library](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/monitoring-plugins) to `/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/lib`, which are a requirement of the Monitoring Plugins.

Additionally, this role allows you to deploy custom plugins which are placed under `{{ inventory_dir }}/host_files/{{ inventory_hostname }}/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins` on the Ansible control node.

Windows only: Since you cannot change files that are currently used by a process in Windows, when running against a Windows host, this role first stops the Icinga2 service, deploys the plugins and starts the service again. Optionally, it sets a downtime for each host. Have a look at the optional role variables below for this.


## Mandatory Requirements

* Install Python 3 (or Python 2 if needed)


## Optional Requirements

* Round about 20 check plugins require the 3rd party [psutil](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. On RHEL-compatible systems, enable the EPEL repository (for example by using the [linuxfabrik.lfops.repo_epel](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/lfops/tree/main/roles/repo_epel) role), then install `python3-psutil`.
* Look at the individual requirements of each check in its README file on [GitHub](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/monitoring-plugins) or on [docs.linuxfabrik.ch](https://docs.linuxfabrik.ch/monitoring-plugins/000-check-plugins.html) to identify any dependencies on additional third-party libraries.
* To let this role compile the Python plugins on Windows using [Nutika](https://nuitka.net/), you need to [install Nuitka first](https://nuitka.net/doc/download.html#pypi).

| `monitoring_plugins`                | Deploys the monitoring plugins, including the Linuxfabrik Plugin Library and custom plugins |
| `monitoring_plugins:custom`         | Only deploys the custom plugins                                                             |

## Optional Role Variables

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `monitoring_plugins__skip_notification_plugins__host_var` / `monitoring_plugins__skip_notification_plugins__group_var` | Skips the deployment of the notification-plugins (in addition to the check-plugins). For the usage in `host_vars` / `group_vars` (can only be used in one group at a time). | `true` |
| `monitoring_plugins__icinga2_api_password` | The password of the `monitoring_plugins__icinga2_api_user`. This is required to schedule a downtime for Windows hosts. | unset |
| `monitoring_plugins__icinga2_api_url` | The address of the Icinga2 master API. This is required to schedule a downtime for Windows hosts. | unset |
| `monitoring_plugins__icinga2_api_user` | The Icinga2 API user. This is required to schedule a downtime for Windows hosts. Therefore, it needs to have the following permissions: `permissions = [ "actions/schedule-downtime", "actions/remove-downtime" ]` | unset |
| `monitoring_plugins__linux_variant` | String. Linux only. Which variant of the monitoring plugins should be deployed? Possible options:<ul><li>`package`: Deploy the packages with the checks compiled by pyinstaller. This does not require Python on the system.</li><li>`python`: Deploy the plugins as source code. This requires Python to be installed.</li></ul> | `'package'` |
| `monitoring_plugins__plugin_list` | Overwrite the automatically generated list of monitoring plugins that should be deployed. Note: This does not work for the compiled Nuitka plugins, as they are all packaged in a single zip-file. | unset |
| `monitoring_plugins__python_version` | For which Python version should the monitoring plugins be deployed? Possible options:<ul><li>`3`: For Python 3</li><li>`2`: For Python 2 (deprecated, therefore not recommended)</li></ul> | `3` |
| `monitoring_plugins__repo_version` | String. Linux only, and only if `monitoring_plugins__linux_variant` is set to `python`: Which version of the monitoring plugins source code should be deployed? Possible options: <ul><li>`latest`: The **latest stable** release. See the [Releases](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/monitoring-plugins/releases).</li><li>`main`: The development version. Use with care.</li><li>A specific release, for example `2022030201`. See the [Releases](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/monitoring-plugins/releases).</li></ul> | `'latest'` |
| `monitoring_plugins__windows_variant` | Windows only. Which variant of the monitoring plugins should be deployed? Possible options:<br> * `nuitka`: Deploy the nuitka-compiled checks (EXE files). This does not require Python on the system.<br> * `python`: Deploy the plain Python plugins. This requires Python to be installed on Windows. | `'nuitka'` |

Example:
```yaml
# optional
monitoring_plugins__skip_notification_plugins__host_var: true
monitoring_plugins__icinga2_api_password: 'linuxfabrik'
monitoring_plugins__icinga2_api_url: 'https://192.0.2.3:5665/v1'
monitoring_plugins__icinga2_api_user: 'downtime-api-user'
monitoring_plugins__linux_variant: 'python'
monitoring_plugins__plugin_list:
  - 'about-me'
  - 'cpu-usage'
monitoring_plugins__python_version: 3
monitoring_plugins__repo_version: 'latest'
monitoring_plugins__windows_variant: 'nuitka'
```

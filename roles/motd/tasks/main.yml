  # Why do we configure the SSHd here, and why don't we simply inject a Banner variable
  # into the sshd role within the motd playbook?
  # The problem here is that the SSH role is executed *completely* upon an inject. This has the
  # effect that the policycore-utils must also be installed up front. Once the sshd role is
  # executed, it hardens the SSH daemon. In the end that's way too many changes to
  # the system overall just to set a simple MOTD.

# This is the configuration file for Icinga DB.

# Connection configuration for the database to which Icinga DB synchronizes monitoring data.
# This is also the database used in Icinga DB Web to view and work with the data.
# In high availability setups, all Icinga DB instances must write to the same database.
database:
  # Database type. Either 'mysql' for MySQL or 'pgsql' for PostgreSQL.
  # Defaults to 'mysql'.
#  type: mysql

  # Database host or absolute Unix socket path.
  host: '{{ icingadb__database_host }}'

  # Database port. By default, the MySQL or PostgreSQL port, depending on the database type.
#  port:

  # Database name.
  database: '{{ icingadb__database_name }}'

  # Database user.
  user: '{{ icingadb__database_login["username"] }}'

  # Database password.
  password: '{{ icingadb__database_login["password"] }}'

# Connection configuration for the Redis server where Icinga 2 writes its configuration, state and history items.
# This is the same connection as configured in the 'icingadb' feature of the corresponding Icinga 2 node.
# High availability setups require a dedicated Redis server per Icinga 2 node and
# therefore a dedicated Icinga DB instance that connects to it.
redis:
  # Redis host or absolute Unix socket path.
  host: '{{ icingadb__redis_host }}'

  # Redis port.
  # Defaults to '6380' since the Redis server provided by the 'icingadb-redis' package listens on that port.
  port: {{ icingadb__redis_port }}

# Icinga DB logs its activities at various severity levels and any errors that occur either
# on the console or in systemd's journal. The latter is used automatically when running under systemd.
# In any case, the default log level is 'info'.
logging:
  # Default logging level. Can be set to 'fatal', 'error', 'warn', 'info' or 'debug'.
  # If not set, defaults to 'info'.
#  level: info

  # Logging output. Can be set to 'console' (stderr) or 'systemd-journald'.
  # If not set, logs to systemd-journald when running under systemd, otherwise stderr.
#  output:

  # Interval for periodic logging defined as duration string.
  # A duration string is a sequence of decimal numbers and a unit suffix, such as "20s".
  # Valid units are "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  # Defaults to "20s".
#  interval: 20s

  # Map of component-logging level pairs to define a different log level than the default value for each component.

# Due to the required compatibility with TLS v1.2, we have to define the SSLCipherSuite as an exception
# (while moz://a does not do this for the "modern config" - TLS 1.3 removed obsolete/insecure
# features like cipher suites, compression etc.).
# But instead of using the output from moz://a SSL Configuration Generator for TLS 1.2, the cipher suites are
# manually sorted by order (best key exchange algorithm/strongest encryption first).
# This is done even if client chooses its favorite algorithm, because that's the only way to get an
# even better number of points in "Key Exchange" on https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest.
